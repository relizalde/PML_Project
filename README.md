Predicting Quality of Weight Lifting Exercise
====================================

Introduction
--------------

This project is part of the Practical Machine Learning course at Coursera. The main objective is to predict how well an activity was performed by a person using an on-body sensor. 

Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions (classes).  One class represents performing the exercise correctly, the remaining four classes represent common mistakes.

The approach taken in this work was using Random Forests. The following sections describe the data preparation, the model building and validation.
